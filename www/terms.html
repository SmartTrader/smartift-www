<h1>Last Updated: August 1, 2017</h1>
<p>By taking part in the SIFT ICO or by buying or selling Smart Investment Fund Tokens (“SIFT”) on the open market at any point in the future you agree to the terms and conditions detailed on this page (the “Terms”).  Terms such as “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Logical Trading Systems Limited (“LTS”), based in the United Kingdom.  If you do not agree to these Terms you cannot buy or sell SIFT.  Purchase of or trading SIFT will be considered an acceptance of the Terms.  It is important to note that you are not investing in SIFT but are taking part in a token sale; we use the terms “Invest” and “Investing” to simplify the concept but this is a complicated technical trade of cryptographic assets not an investment.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to change or modify any conditions within these Terms at any time at our sole discretion.  We will provide notice of changes by updating this page.  The inherent nature of Ethereum contracts means that we cannot contact you directly and as such it is your responsibility to check these Terms regularly.</p>
<br />
<h1>Structure and Token Sale</h1>
<p>SIFT is a product of Logical Trading Systems Limited.  It is not an investment fund nor is it the sole activity of Logical Trading Systems Limited.  Owning SIFT refers to being in possession of the private keys for an Ethereum address that has a SIFT balance allocated to it.  LTS are not aware of who, as a legal entity, is in possession of such keys.  An owner of SIFT may be referred to as a “Shareholder” but it is important to note that they are not a legal shareholder in Logical Trading Systems Limited.</p>
<p>Sending the SIFT initial coin offering (“ICO”) smart contract a value of ETH during the ICO period will allocate a balance of SIFT to the sending address at a rate of 100 SIFT per ETH with a minimum allocation of 1 SIFT and no maximum allocation.  You are not purchasing SIFT nor are you investing in LTS as a business but are exchanging one digital token for another.</p>
<p>Once the ICO completes LTS may do one of two things:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide to cancel the token sale and return all ETH to the addresses that sent ETH in the first place.  In this situation, all Ethereum addresses that sent funds to the ICO contract will have to manually request a withdrawal via the Ethereum network.  This will be automatically executed and we will have no access to your ETH balance.  If this happens the fund will not trade and all rights relating to holding SIFT will be immediately revoked.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decide to proceed with the token sale.  In this a situation, all ETH is withdrawn gradually and converted in to USD, GBP or EUR fiat currencies.  The cumulative sum of all these withdrawals in fiat currency will have 15% deducted from an (the “Operating Cost Fund”) and the remainder will be determined as the initial “Fund Value”.  This Fund Value will depend upon exchange rates at the time of conversion and may have a higher or lower value than the ETH that was used originally.  The Operating Cost Fund will be used to cover initial costs required for LTS to operate SIFT.<br />
You will be allocated a SIFT balance as soon as funds are sent to the ICO contract but you will not be able to send SIFT to other Ethereum addresses until the ICO has been marked as successfully closed.</p>
<br />
<h1>Entitlements</h1>
<p>Being in possession of SIFT entitles the holder to a share of revenue generated from the crypto-trading activities of LTS.  We call this “Profit” but it is important to note how we determine Profit and to understand that this is not the full profit of LTS as an entity but rather a very specific definition.</p>
<p>The amount that each Ethereum address possessing SIFT is entitled to is calculated as follows:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount we receive in non-crypto currency at the end of a trading transaction minus the amount we spent at the start of the start of the transaction is “Transaction Gross Profit”<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any taxes and fees related to the transaction (including, but not limited to: exchange fees, transaction fees and capital gains tax) are deducted from the “Transaction Profit” to create the “Transaction Net Profit”<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where (1) was a negative amount (2) will also be negative and this would represent a loss of funds during a trade<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sum of all Transaction Net Profit amounts are added together (including any losses) to determine the “Monthly Trading Profit”<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Monthly Trading Profit is negative no management fees are changed and no dividends are paid out.  This this scenario the Fund Value is decreased by the cumulative Transaction Gross Profit for the month.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is a positive Monthly Trading Profit:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fee is taken from it and given to LTS.  This fee is the lower of 1.5% of the entire Fund Value or 15% of the Monthly Trading Profit.  No fee is charged until the cumulative amount of fees that should have been charged exceeds the money allocated to the Operating Cost Fund.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining value after the fee has been taken is the “Dispersion Amount”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half of the Dispersion Amount is added to the previous month’s Fund Value to give the new fund value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The remaining Dispersion Amount is converted to ETH and send to a smart contract<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This smart contract allocates the ETH between all SIFT owners equally so that the total amount of ETH sent per SIFT is equal to half the Dispersion Amount divided by the total SIFT in circulation</p>
<p>Each owner of SIFT is entitled to sell their ownership of SIFT to any other Ethereum address using whatever payment system they desire.  The SIFT token smart contracts permits an amount of SIFT to be allocated to any other address.  We envisage that the market value of SIFT will relate to the Fund Value at any moment in time but can make no guarantees of any market for SIFT tokens nor for their value.</p>
<p>Addresses with a SIFT balance are entitled to vote on specific decisions with regards to changes in trading style.  These votes are limited to the below activities and the structure of each vote and voting thresholds will be announced with each vote:<br />
1.	Taking in further funding<br />
2.	Closing the fund down<br />
3.	Trading a new pair</p>
<p>We may, at our own discretion, offer other votes to holders of SIFT.  These votes will take place via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  Such votes in no way give holders of SIFT any rights to manage the day-to-day activities of LTS nor does it infer any legal voting rights with regards to LTS.</p>
<br />
<h1>Transparency</h1>
<p>LTS agrees to be transparent about the Fund Value at all times.  To ensure transparency the following will be attempted by LTS:<br />
1.	Weekly display of account balances in fiat currencies via an Ethereum smart contract<br />
2.	Reporting of trades to an Ethereum smart contract as they are opened or closed<br />
3.	All tokens, cryptocurrencies and funds returned to bank accounts before balance summaries are displayed<br />
4.	Release of public API tokens for trading platforms where trading platforms will allow it<br />
5.	An independent audit of the figures that we release every three months</p>
<p>As long as these remain technically possible SIFT will continue to report this information at the scheduled defined or more regularly.  If, for any reason, technical or otherwise, this is not possible then SIFT will still ensure an independent audit is conducted every three months and the results of this are reported on our website at https://SmartIFT.com.</p>
<p>Any rights not expressly defined in these Terms are not inferred upon owners of SIFT whether or not they have appeared in material published by LTS.</p>
<br />
<h1>Eligibility</h1>
<p>We cannot advise on areas of eligibility for purchasing SIFT and it is important that you are aware of local regulations in your country.  There may be local laws that put limits on how you invest in token sales and it is also important that you understand the tax implications of buying and selling SIFT.</p>
<p>We expressly forbid the purchase of SIFT under the following circumstances:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any citizens or resident of the United States of America or its territories that would fall under regulation with regards to the sale and marketing of securities in these territories<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anybody that must be certified in some way in their own country</p>
<br />
<h1>Risk Statement</h1>
<p>You should ensure you are aware of the risks prior to obtaining SIFT.  We believe the following list details the main risks that you will want to consider but we would always recommend that you seek independent financial advice before engaging in any endeavour:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any calculations regarding ROI are projections and not guarantees<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of cryptocurrency is liable to change and any ETH that you purchase SIFT with today may be worth less, or more, when the fund commences trading – this could change the value of your SIFT-holding<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are not participating in an investment scheme but are buying a digital token.  Trading tokens can be risky and in many territories the regulatory infrastructure is not yet clear.  It is important you are aware of your local regulatory and taxation requirements when considering your returns.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Smart Contracts that power SIFT and the dividend system and based on Ethereum standards.  How Ethereum and such smart contracts works is an extremely complicated technical area and you should have advanced technical knowledge to understand the associated risks with the underlying platforms and smart contracts.  We give no guarantees with regards to the future security of the Ethereum network or our smart contracts.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past performance of our trading activities and back-testing is not a guarantee for future performance.  We publish our risk management and trading strategies but cannot guarantee how they will work in to the future.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of your SIFT-holding could go down as well as up, there are no guaranteed profits as trading is inherently risky<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will occasionally use leverage during trades.  Although we do not plan to ever leverage more than the underlying asset value that we store we may chose leverage where it makes sense to trade with lower transaction fees.  In such instances, it is important to note that sudden drastic changes in price could close an entire position resulting in a loss for a trade.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logical Trading Systems Limited is not liable for any losses caused during trading activities.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you own SIFT and wish to sell your holding to another entity that trade is completely outside of our scope.  The prices, method of transfer and any associated risks lie solely with you as the person that controls that amount of SIFT.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the structure of SIFT you are at risk from the following fluctuations:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USD, EUR and GBP currency transaction rates<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of Ethereum compared to these currencies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of cryptocurrencies during a trade</p>
