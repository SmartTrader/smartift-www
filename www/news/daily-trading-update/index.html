                  <p>Trades were closed today but was fairly slow.  A lot of craziness with Brexit and trade wars.  We still and have some longer term bets there.</p>

                  <p>No trades were closed today.  I am planning on winding down a number of crypto positions over the next few weeks *if* prices are advantageous now that the crypto holdings are back in the trading account.  We can then start to move the funds into where we can make it work best.  Some automation trades that were left going after the bots shut down will be closed down as well over the next few days, hopefully in better spots.</p>

                  <p>The forex automation is live.  Automated Trades were closed today. I expect to ramp up the manual trading a bit ahead of the end of year slow down. The bot performance continues to be lackluster compared to the testing which is a recurring theme unfortunately.  I am unsure if it will pick up or not so I think the proposals made to ramp up the forex is the way to go rather than continously bleed money with bots.</p>

                  <p>The automation is live and opened its first trade today.  I confirmed with Guy that the configuration for this trade setup was correct because I expected it would close the trade much earlier than it did. It caused us to have a net loss for the day unfortunately even with a few profitable trades of my own.  In our testing, there were some great results so I am leaving it to work as it's meant to.  Trade sizes will get a bit larger over the next week or so for manual trades initially and depending on automation results over the next couple of weeks, for that as well.</p>

                  <p>Hello all.  This is the first update since Guy visited. We got a lot of work done and a number of systems are going into action as of today.  Manual charting was a bit slow today for me and as a result no trades were closed today</p>

                  <p>Trading will be sporadic while Guy is here as we have only a limited amont of time together.  A lot of progress already.  Trades were closed today</p>

                  <p>As always if you have any questions, please let us know in the channel.</p>
