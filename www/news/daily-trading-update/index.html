                  <p>The automation is live and opened its first trade today.  I confirmed with Guy that the configuration for this trade setup was correct because I expected it would close the trade much earlier than it did. It caused us to have a net loss for the day unfortunately even with a few profitable trades of my own.  In our testing, there were some great results so I am leaving it to work as it's meant to.  Trade sizes will get a bit larger over the next week or so for manual trades initially and depending on automation results over the next couple of weeks, for that as well.</p>

                  <p>Hello all.  This is the first update since Guy visited. We got a lot of work done and a number of systems are going into action as of today.  Manual charting was a bit slow today for me and as a result no trades were closed today</p>

                  <h4>September 14th 4:37 PM GMT</h4>


                  <p>Trading will be sporadic while Guy is here as we have only a limited amont of time together.  A lot of progress already.  Trades were closed today</p>

                  <p>As always if you have any questions, please let us know in the channel.</p>
