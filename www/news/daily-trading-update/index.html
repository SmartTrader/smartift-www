             <h4>June 22nd 5:12 GMT</h4>
             <p>Late report but technically not done trading for today.  Still, I wanted to get something up in the normal time.  Automation is proving to take much longer on Forex and we're are simply missing to many moves overnight so I am going to start trading later/earlier to see if we can't get some things rolling.  We have a number of trade open on crypto that, again, some are up and some are flat to down slightly.  We have had some really nice  movement today and in general the signals were perfect but I wasn't up to take advantage of them.  It's getting pretty frustrating.  As always if you have any questions please let us know in the channel.  If anyone is up late and wants to talk shop I'll be up for a bit.</p>
            
                        
            <h4>June 21th 4:19 GMT</h4>
             <p>Crypto Automation is Enabled but I am managing trades manually for now. We had a nice rise up and are up decently on  some positions.  We are  sideways some others but signs of strength for a very long while so holding.  Forex trades were closed today.  Testing of automation is ongoing.  Nothing has changed on that front since last report. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us in the channel.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h4>June 20th 4:02 GMT</h4>
             <p>Crypto Automation is Enabled but I am managing trades manually for now. We had a bit of heavy news later in the day (Bitthumb Hack) that pushed most coins back off their highs.  We have some nice gains on some and are  sideways slightly again to down on some others after the drop.  No Forex trades were closed today.  Testing of automation is ongoing.  I still expect we'll be able to start soon but we need more tetsing completed for all types of pairs (High Vol, low vol, majors, exotics, etc) before we can go live. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us in the channel.</p>
            
            
            
            <h4>June 19th 3:28 GMT</h4>
             <p>Crypto Automation is Enabled but I am managing open trades manually at present.  We have had a fairly sideways to slightly up slightly down action on currently open positions.  I will wind them down as we get a clearer sense of direction with the basic systems and automated entries can resume without manual input. Forex trades were closed today for a small profit. We are a bit further along on the Forex automation but it does take a while to complete each test.  I expect we'll be able to start soon but we need more tetsing completed for all types of pairs (High Vol, low vol, majors, exotics, etc) before we can go live.

            <h4>June 13th 4:09 GMT</h4>
             <p>Crypto Automation is enabled and trades are open. I was expecting some upward momentum to take us up a bit higher.  We got some weakness signals overnight and had a resulting downward move instead.  I mistakenly thought we would continue up to flat for the over night trades but I should have set targets and didn't.  We did get some strength earlier today on a number of coins so holding off on adding or closing just yet. Forex automation testing was going on much of the day today and the results are very promising (Not unexpected)  We have a bit of testing to do still to get systems online but I have started some readying for the trading machines and will continue that tomorrow. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us in the channel.</p>

We are also looking to optimize exits as most trades can be as high as 2-4% or higher before coming back.

            <h4>June 1st 5:24 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation is live and managing open trades, potentially trading overnight.  I am having issues connecting to the remote trading machines and have a message in to Guy but it's late for me and not quite late enough for him. There are potentially some issues that may pop up in terms of the automation still related to filtering out for certain types of signal locations.  Guy and I will work this out when I am back next week.  I will be away from the 2nd of June until the 6th of June on business.  This impacts only the first couple of trading days as it falls on a weekend so I will miss two days of trading instead of five.  The bot will be live unless there are problems that pop up related to the issues I mentioned.  I will be in communication with Guy if anything needs doing from the automation perspective.  I will check in the channel periodically as well, so if you have any issues or questions please post them and I can help.</p>
            
            
             <h4>May 31th 3:49 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation is live and managing open trades and potentially trading overnight. Work is being completed on the automation for forex which should be a lot quicker.  If you have any issues or questions please post them in the channel and I can help.</p>
            
            
            
            
                         <h4>May 30th 4:24 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation was live and generally performed as it should in terms of settings.  There was a bug on entries for open short trades that were to be closed and reopened.  Trades were not closed properly so new trade wasn't opened which caused us to be wrong on initial trade.  It's a bit complicated to explain so I posted up a chart detailing the issues visually.  Details on this are in the channel.  As a result of trading today a few last minute things were added to ensure the automation would stay on track after a weekend or manual close of trades. That should hopefully do it for the Crypto automation.  There is one Dash trade live at the moment which was based on a faulty entry (Climax) but I thought it was okay to hold as we didn't move much in either direction from entry earlier today.  I was busy with some personal things earlier so I disabled bot to ensure it was running when I can watch to make sure it's doing as it should.
            I will be able to devote tomorrow to testing to ensure the new features and trades in general are being opened and managed as they should.  I think we're all set finally. If you have any issues or questions please post them in the channel and I can help.</p>

             <p>Trades are open.  Automation is currently disabled.  Due to the way the automation runs I disabled it from trading overnight as there is a chance a short could trigger and after a significant move down this is less than ideal, even if it ends up being okay as it was today, it's risky.  As of yet, no sign of strength coming in on BTC.  We did get a strength indication on ETH and a small long position was opened.  I will be out most of tomorrow for my oldest daughters graduation ceremony and party.  I will have phone and will be checking in.  As always let us know if you have any questions in the channel.  A note regarding the exchange.  Zapple for those that didn't know now has 2fa enabled so we recommend turning that on and let us know if you have any issues or questions.</p>
            
            
            
            
            <h4>May 23rd 3:28 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation system is running and trades have been opened and closed.  This is a combined update for yesterday and today.  I mentioned in the channel that my main machine was taking an exceptionally long time with a windows update so I did an informal update in the channel.  The automation system is now more closely matching what I see but there are still some questions about time frames which I mentioned in the channel and I would like to look at a bit further.  Nothing that keeps us from opening or closing trades just some things we can do possibly to get in earlier.  We had a number of short indications and trades and after a fairly solid move down we got some strength indications which I had reservations about.  I turned the bot off as a precaution even though it did ultimately work out.  I am waiting for a strength on a time frame that has been fairly accurate but thus far it has not materialized so the outlook is still short.  If you have any questions please put them in the channel and I can help.</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            <h4>May 19th 3:24 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation system is running and trades have been opened and closed.  We are investigating some trade selection issues as far as back test vs. real world trading goes.  We have disabled the shorter term method until we can verify the directions are established correctly in the first place as something seems off somewhere.  Visually using my own system the trades were opposite to what the automation was taking and I am trying to reconcile why.  There are a number of differences in terms of the systems and data the automation uses based on back testing vs. what I look at so it's likely just a matter of adjusting the live systems to more closely match what makes sense to me logically.  If you have any questions please put them in the channel and I can help.</p>
            
            
                    
            
            
            <h4>May 18th 3:24 GMT</h4>
             <p>Automation system is running and trades have been opened and closed.  Some connection issues on some earlier entries caused the system to stay in long because it didn't get the change from the system and as a result didn't get the corresponding short entry.  The system itself signaled fairly perfectly which is great.  We'll need to work out a way to force it to stay connected.  It may just have been a one off anomaly as Guy just said there was an update to a machine and the automation system failed to reconnect.  Whatever it was we'll work it out.  I posted some screenshots and discussed the issue in the channel earlier today if anyone wants to take a look.  I was out for a bit last night, today and will be tomorrow as well.  If anyone has any questions please feel free to raise them in the channel and I'll check in the morning.</p>

             <p>Automation issues have been worked out for now and is set to resume using the new system later today/tomorrow.  The method used as a work around for the advisor system wonkiness returns 19% on average per month.  Testing will continues on some other shorter term trade setups that employ the same system but applied to signals on shorter time frames. This should provide decent results each day as well as the longer term moves it will capture.  Forex automation is the next major thing to be done trading wise so we'll still need to correct the advisor system but it will take significantly less time to correct as it does not require regenerating the data each time a change is made. Manual Forex trading will begin again in the mean time now that I can focus on trading rather than optimizing and testing.  If anyone has any questions please let us know in the channel.</p>

             <p>Crypto automation was live and taking trades for part of the day but was disabled later in the day as there was an issue.  It should be resolved.  Trades will still be a bit wonky while I finalise some workarounds to the advisor systems issue which will allow us to not rely on them entirely instead of waiting until those issues are fully resolved.  I went into detail in the channel about what is happening so take a look there to get up to speed. For closed trades results, check the report links above to follow along with trades that are closed and open throughout the day on crypto as well as forex. I had some family stuff to attend to most of today which is why the report is slightly later than normal.  If anyone has any questions feel free to contact us in the channel.

Please note: While we are testing the automated systems the per coin limit is 10K and the percentages are based on that.  Its still slightly wonky donkey but it's running and we are adjusting as we go for now. I have built a system/method that should keep the bot on track during volatile moves, and should also be able to capture much larger moves fairly risk free (Read draw down) This will work especially well on coins we can go both long and short but will be lopsided on some (just longs).

            <p>Trades were closed today on Forex for a profit of $1023.07 (After-tax $828.68).  The automation system is disabled so no crypto trades were opened or closed while I pinpoint the issues with trade selection.  The trading this month was extremely light as you might have guessed from the reports.  I spent much of the month trying to match up the systems as I have mentioned in the reports and the channel.  I have a list of the actual logic for the signals and advisory systems in version 5 and I am working on ensuring they are correct.  We have found some issues with some signals, so I wanted to make sure everything is correct.  I don't think will take very long and once done we can get the automation enabled and trading every day.

            "Feeling a bit under the weather this evening so hitting the sack early.  I'll do the daily report tomorrow but quickly... No trades on forex today (Friday).  Automation closed and opened trades.  There was a pretty serious issue with trade selection so I closed it for part of today.  We had some really decent moves that it did catch but was in the wrong way on some due to the issue reported earlier in here.  I'll start it up again in the AM so I can monitor it as it goes.

I continued today to try to define differences in the automation system as we match up the two versions (Mine and Automation).  There are trades that are open in both Forex and automation are signal to signal trades that can be open for an hour at a minimum, or longer depending on time frame, signals, and targets.  The bot closed trades thus far have been good.  Guy reported in the channel some of the early results so far but there are open trades open that I expect to close later this evening or early tomorrow. II am allowing the system to open and close on its own as I continue to match the two versions. If there are any questions feel free to join us in the telegram channel.

            <p>No trades were closed today on Forex. The automation system is live and opened and closed trades today.  Update on work being done.  I spent most of today trying to hammer down some better rules for the system as we match up the two versions (Mine and Automation).  The trades that are open in both Forex and automation are signal to signal trades that can be open for an hour at a minimum, or longer depending on time frame, signals, and targets.  The bot closed trades thus far have been good.  One earlier today was 9ish percent on its own but had some that weren't so great too and trades as of reporting are still open.  That said I am allowing the system to open and close on its own as I optimize and try to narrow down and match the two versions.   As I mentioned in yesterdays report even with the differences the testing bot forward and now live have been acceptable.  It can be better though.  In terms of issues related to running, the connection and running issues seem to be solved as I didn't see any errors in the log and the system is up and running.

            <p>No trades were closed today technically however I will remind those that might be newer, this does not mean trading wasn't done.  The automation system is live.  It opened and closed a number trades and  has some open trades as of this report time.  The system took a number of trades today and is doing as it was during forward testing.  It has a net positive profit for the day and reporting will be sorted as we build out a system for that.  The trades that are open in both Forex and automation are signal to signal trades that can be open for an hour at a minimum, or longer depending on time frame, signals, and targets.  As I mentioned we are working out some differences in terms of entries that I see vs what the bot sees but trading using volume even if a machine, is going to be better than most anything else.  The bot had some issues when we initially started it but I think those are all ironed out and it should now run continuously over night.  As always if there are any questions feel free to join us in the telegram channel.

            <p>No trades were closed today however, after initially having some issues getting it started over the weekend, the bot is now running and taking trades.  As I mentioned in the channel, there is still some work to be done in regards to ensuring it trades as I do.  While it doesn't quite match up the results in forward testing have been positive so we felt it was okay to start.  I don't want any false expectations for those that follow my trading chatter in various channels as it's not quite right yet.  It is doing well and Guy and I are working on  tightening it up as much as possible over the next week and beyond.  It will never match 100% with what I do but should be close enough to get trades I would take overnight which is all we need.  As my confidence in the bots trade selection improves, we'll ramp up the numbers and work toward doing the same thing for Forex.  Trades are missed there for the same reason and we have the added issue of our President and all the problems his rants each day bring to the markets when I am trading.

Some longer term trades hit targets and some MHTC trades brought us up a bit but when all was said and done we ended the day with a net loss.  Plus side is automation should be starting up and working out some automation for multiple time frames and charts for Forex as well so we can maximize opportunities through out the day and night</p>
            
            
            <h4>April 5th 4:06 GMT</h4>
            <p>A bit of a wonky day today as we had a bit of personal emergency here.  Forex trades were closed for a profit of $240.00 (after-tax profit of $194.4) MHTC trades and a lot of mixed signals.  Some trades are open overnight and I will report on those when closed in tomorrows report</p>

            <p>MHTC Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $480.50 (After-tax profit of $389.20)..  Work on automation continues.  Hopefully we'll be ready to start this weekend. Ramping up sizing on Forex but a lack of proper signals due to external news/concerns leaves little opportunity in my time zone.  Forex could benefit from some automation as well and we'll look at that as well.</p>

            <p>Small MHTC Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $500.00 (After-tax profit of $405.00)..  The trades were mostly flat for the day and really only started to move a short while ago.  Some gave signs of reversals so rather than risk holding them overnighit I can pick it up again in the morning.</p>

            <pNo trades closed today.  It was a fairly odd day of mixed signals so I spent most of the day tightening up the rules for the Automation Systems and watching charts.  The forward testing for automation has been going well and I hope to have it ready by the first and possibly some small runs ahead of that.  Forex continues to be a bit risky in light of the trade issues with the US so it is best to sit on the side lines until things start to return to normalcy volume analysis wise.</p>

            A bit of a crazy day news wise in Forex as a result a number of positions were closed out pretty quickly and some have some DD currently.  Nothing too worrying and will keep my eye on things a bit overnight.  USD weakness should abate and wind down some of these positions</p>

            Not much happening with USD.  I expected to see some weakness and took some positions using MHTC but mainly we are flat to down on them.  I expect that we will see them closed overnight.  Automation testing is still going very well and we'll discuss starting it out possibly as early as tomorrow (my time).</p>

<p>I was a bit wiped out this evening and had some issues with the reporting system as there were multiple trades in LTC and I couldn't see a way to cope with this in the current system without taking a lot more time.  These numbers should be spot on but may be revised upwards or downwards slightly if any issues are found.  I'll ask Guy take a look when he's up which should be soon so keep an eye out for a revised report if needed.</p>

<p>Forex:<br /> 
    I had a bit of a mishap while remoting in using my phone to check positions earlier today.  I inadvertently closed two trades as a result of lag (I assume) using remote desktop.  I wasn't even aware that they had closed until I had gotten back to the office and checked properly. I will disabled one click trading as a precaution when away in the future. Those trades as well as some other trades closed at profit resulted in a net loss of $1654.79 in our forex account.</p>

            <p>As some as you know I have not updated forward facing sheets for trades.  I will update and finalize these over the coming weekend possibly sooner for all crypto trades this month.  Guy and I will go over them to ensure they are correct and up to date.  The numbers here are accurate and can be used in lieu of the spreadsheets for the next few days or less.</p>

Thanks for your patience.

            <p>Crypto: I have started some position building at these lower levels in the hopes to bring our average entries down with the expectation that we could see moves upward over the next few days or longer. Weakness was prevalent much of today after some nice moves earlier so not much to report in terms of intraday trades.  I expect Position building will be a beast for us this month if we have some extended moves upward and forex will ramp up too.  </p>
                
                <p>Forex: It has been a slow start this year thus far thanks in part to the rather unpredictable nature of our leader in the US. There are a lot of issues with confidence and currency/market traders and I think that's why it's taking longer to get solid signals.  The same thing happened last year but it was  on track nearly from the start of January.  The quick hits intraday will help and I will continue to do those</p>

            <p>While we continue to have dollar confidence issues in the US as well as crypto weakness to contend with, I was able to trade quick moves within the moves.  I am likely going to ramp these types of trades up on days where markets are contending with external news as they have been for some time now.  I can explain more in channel if anyone is interested.  Totals for all closed trades are below with detailed positions in crypto listed below that</p>

            </p>
                        
            <h4>January 24th 5:09 GMT</h4>
			<p>Forgive the late report.  I was celebrating a family birthday and it ran a bit later than I expected.  Two smaller forex trades were closed for 664.23 bringing the monthly closed trade profit to $42124.86
            Forex is slowly picking up steam.  When current crypto trades are closed they will be reported here.

			<p>Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $3,139.00 bringing the monthly profit to date to $41,460.63.  It's taken a little while to get some signals after the winter slow down but we are seeing more activity now.  Profits were booked and some continuation signals were taken. In Crypto... Light position building was done earlier today at very near what was the bottom of the fairly significant move down.  Position building entails more risk than our normal trading because we hold positions longer and are subject to volatility risks.  Given the large moves down I decided we could start to take some positions.  I may close these out sooner as part of our general trades as some (XRP) are up roughly 40-50% already.  Please note:  Position trades tend to be smaller as we build.  As a result closing them out earlier will result in less profit in terms of actual dollars.  I don't like to discuss open positions because everyone has an opinion but as always I am open to questions and comments.  Have a good day</p>

This carried over loss from last month with today's profit brings the monthly profit total to $55,056.42.</p>

			<p>The BTC position has been closed for $10,060.95 profit at a price of $7,868.24 (with 2.524 BTC having already been sold at lower prices).  This was closed after BTC reached a new level of VSR and valid weakness signal was encountered.</p>

			<p>The total Forex trade profit, after fees, for the month stands at $1,437.</p>

			<h4>November 16th 05:41 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  There are a couple of trades on CFD off the daily chart that I will report when closed.</p>
			<p>We spent much of today going over some major updates to our Smart VSA platforms.  These should help us capture more moves in all markets and especially crypto.  There is some work to do still and I hope to get it up and running in the next few days.  I'll provide more details in the coming days on these developments.</p>
			<p>The BTC position is still open.  No additions were made to the position and none was closed.</p>

			<h4>November 15th 04:23 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  A total of $230.00 profit was made on CFD trades this includes the trade overnight mentioned in the update yesterday.  As I mentioned in the room earlier today, the profit is on a trade size in most cases roughly one tenth of normal.  There were no daily Forex trades so I started working out smaller/faster trades on shorter timeframes and used smaller trades sizes accordingly.  The BTC position is still active and while we missed a signal over night to add on we have not yet gotten a short signal to exit. We will update on this and any other positions as needed.</p>

			<h4>November 14th 04:58 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  We did some small testing on CFD positions in Forex intraday as no daily signals for the charts we look at occured.  Each trade was profitable but in terms of actual dollars traded and profited it wasn't very much as we were testing.  We have some trades open with profit targets that should hit overnight.  They will be reported tomorrow.  The BTC position is still open and I expect we may hold it a little while longer.  We are going to trade within the position a bit starting tomorrow if we have trade signals worth executing.  Today saw mostly some more shifting around with nothing safe in terms of opening positions for the fund.</p>

			<h4>November 12th 11:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have been closed since Friday and a <a href="/news/bch-btc-trading-update/index.html">separate statement has been issued</a> on the BCH/BTC volatility.</p>

			<h4>November 10th 05:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed today.  CFD Forex trades had only one trade which was closed for a profit at the start of the trading day for $1075.00.</p>
			<p>Signals we trade were fairly nonexistent on everything or were invalidated by our advisory systems throughout most of the day.  It is likely do to the news yesterday as things fall back into line in terms of "normal" trading such as it is.</p>
			<p>In regards to CFD movement and Forex,  Forex too had no valid trades today.  As mentioned in the channel earlier today  we are going to start developing and testing some techniques to try and capture more of the moves on days when volume activity doesn't offer much in terms of clear direction intra day but longer term moves are anticipated.  As always this will be discussed when finalized with SIFT holders.</p>

			<h4>November 9th 09:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Yesterday ETHUSD and XRPUSD trades were closed out for profits of 5.14% and 5.61% respectively.  The Segwit2x announcement and impact on the market caused us to assess our current Bitcoin stratergy and we <a href="https://smartift.com/news/btc-fork-cancellation-trading-update/">released a detailed statement</a> on this issue.  Forex trading saw several small lots traded for an additional $222 increasing monthly forex profits to $1,032.</p>

			<h4>November 8th 2017 04:31 GMT</h4>
			<p>We closed a long position today on LTC for 7.53%  It was a small position on an exchange account from USDT Movement and DCA on valid system signals.</p>
			<p>We had a long CFD Forex that was closed.  Profit for CFD account is +911.00.  There are some other trades open currently and made some more movement in regards to positioning for the upcoming BTC fork.</p>

			<h4>November 7th 2017 03:57 GMT</h4>
			<p>No exchange trades were closed yesterday.  There were a number of moves on the trading front both towards the upcoming fork accumulation as well as Forex and CFD trading. These will be reported after clarification with the team.</p>

			<p>Two trades were closed this morning.  Both positions were longs opened yesterday.  An ETH long closed for 6.46% profit whilst the LTC long closed for 6.42% profit.  The total profit for these trades was $1,369.  Had we been trading with full fund value and maintained this percentage, the combined profit would have been approximately $33,000.  The trading value was limited yesterday as it was the first set of live trades using a change to our algorithms that we have been testing offline for the past two weeks.  We limited the maximum trading fund value to approximately $50,000 yesterday.  Today we will double that to $100,000.  Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">our trading spreadsheet</a> for more details.</p>

			<h4>October 20th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>A 20 Bitcoin buy order was closed yesterday realising a profit of $1,531.  The trade was for $111,640 and returned a 1.37% profit.  We exited as planned near the peak of yesterday's market but current liquidity issues, even with a slow-close over 30 minutes, took the price at close down to an average of $5,674.28.  A full analysis of this trade was provided in the <a href="https://t.me/smartift">Telegram room</a>.  Had we traded the full $515,715 allocated to Bitcoin and been able to exit at the market price this trade would have seen a $10,000 profit.  The on-going liquidity issues and solutions to them have been discussed in Telegram today and will be included in the end-of-month report due shortly. Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">the trade spreadsheet</a> for more details.</p>

			<h4>October 13th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>We have closed out three long positions in DASH, ETH and LTC for a combined profit of $9,014.13.  These trades only used a combined exposure of $138,710.  Had the maximum amounts been traded for these pairs and the exit prices remained the same the profit would have been $46,842.  Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">the trade spreadsheet</a> for a full summary of these trades.  No other positions are currently open.</p>

			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 10th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>We executed a trade using company funds to purchase ETH on October 2nd.  This was to move a balance between exchanges.  Because this was not originally for investment purposes it was not reported at the time.  However, the movement ended up generating a profit of $5,947.85 and we have attributed that profit to the fund.</p>

			<p>The chat channel mentioned yesterday that we were in a short position.  The market direction quickly reversed and we attempted to close the trade.  Due to problems with an exchange under DDoS at the time we wanted to close the trade it meant that the trade turned into a loss.  We monitored the trade and gradually closed it out over the intervening hours.  Due to exchange issues with this trade we are absorbing the loss from this trade out of our own profits.  We have also implemented an algorithm change to prevent these trades being flagged in the future and will discuss this in full detail in the first monthly summary.</p>

			<h4>October 7th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were opened on Friday after climax bars came in on all markets.</p>

			<h4>October 6th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We have closed out both long positions we had open on BTC and ETH as these stalled slightly below their target prices but climax bars suggested upcoming instability in prices.  These closed out for 1.59% and 2.15% profit respectively and can be found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">our trade spreadsheet</a>.  No additional trades have been opened.</p>

			<h4>October 5th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The two trades that were opened on October 4th remain open.  Since the trades have opened there has only been minor movement and neither profit nor loss targets for either of these trades has been hit.  The trades will remain open until an appropriate target is hit.</p>

			<h4>October 4th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We are currently in two trades for an exposure of $120,000.  These two trades have not yet closed.  Once they have closed they will be added to the trade spreadsheet.</p>

			<h4>October 3rd 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Today started with many climax bars on all charts.  These signals indicate unpredictable volatility and are often news related.  We do not trade for a number of hours after these bars as part of our risk mitigation strategy for the fund.  No trades were made today as a consequence.</p>

			<h4>September 29th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered no trades today and is ready to begin full levels of trading starting Monday 2nd October.  A full trading update will be given at the end of the day (GMT) on Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 28th 2017 21:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The ETH short-sell that was opened yesterday was closed for 1.33% profit after it met the target price.  No further trades have been taken today.  Signals were detected but outside of trading hours.   As reported previously we are actively looking at changing our trading hours after the market changes post-China.</p>
			<p>The LTCUSD close reported yesterday was detailed as a 2.2% profit based on its opening cost.  The overall profit for this trade should be considered 1.5% as additional LTC were purchased as part of dollar-value-averaging.  Not all of these ETH were held at the same time but this better represents the actual profit-versus-expenditure on the transactions.</p>		  
			<p>We now have the daily trading spreadsheet online which will detail all trades we take.  This will be updated every day with trades once they are closed.  You can access this spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">here</a>.

			<h4>September 27th 2017 23:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD reached its target of $55 and has been closed.  The trade made a profit of 2.2% based on its opening cost of $37,897 and a profit of $818.14.  A new trade has just been entered to short-sell 100 ETH.  Full trading with larger volumes will commence from Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 26th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open but with a much smaller holding.  We are down to 150LTC held from a peak of 1000LTC.  The trade is overall up just over 1% and the remaining LTC will be sold if there is any indication of a breach of lower support levels or if it reaches the trade target of $55.  The market has remained flat with the only valid signals today being near other signals that suggested market indecision or panic moves that we ignore for risk mitigation.</p>
			<p>The following was posted to Telegram by James earlier today: "As you know I ran into some issues trying to exit ltc last week.  It was a bit daunting as it was a pretty small trade and should have been able to exit without an issue.  Many of the systems we worked out for live trading such as spreading out to multiple exchanges are not live until the first so I have no worries in that regard.  I just wanted to let you know why the lack of trades.  Official start is 1st.    Systems are all working and we had some nice valid entries on btc and eth this morning (weakness).  As we are still working out some details I am waiting on taking any trades even if small.  If you have any questions let me know here."</p>

			<h4>September 25th 2017 22:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open and has now returned the fund to profit beyond its original opening levels.  A number of LTC have been slowly sold off today.  The trade is currently at a 1% profit.  There are current signals that suggest this trade may be closed out shortly.  No new trades have been entered today.</p>

			<h4>September 24th 2017 18:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>With the state of the markets over the last week we made a decision to keep the LTC trade open over the weekend to ensure it was not cashed out at a significant loss.  The trade remains open.  The total loss is $3,489.83 at current prices with 850 LTC held.  These have been dollar-value-avereaged to reduce loss with a slow reduction in holding.  A validated strength signal appeared on LTC over the weekend.  Despite SR levels indicating more sideways market movement this was a factor in not closing out the trade early and continuing to monitor it.</p>

			<h4>September 21st 2017 22:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have spent the most of the last 24 hours trending sideways resulting in no opportunities for Smart to enter the market.  This has also resulted in the Litecoin trade opened earlier in the week still being held.  The downward movements in the market today were detected by Smart but the AI advisor warned against entering the trades.  A number of long signals were indicated this evening but these too were warned against by our AI advisor.  As such no new trades have been opened today.</p>

			<h4>September 20th 2017 21:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have remained fairly flat since yesterday.  We have had no additional validated trades and the LTC trade that was opened yesterday remains open and valid.  Currently the trade is at a profit but will remain open until targets are reached.  The nature of the markets over the last 48 hours have limited trading opportunities somewhat.</p>

			<h4>September 19th 2017 20:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered its first trade.  We've taken a long trade on LTC which has still not reached targets for close.  This first trade is only using $37,897 of capital whilst we ramp up trading during this period.  We originally entered the trade at 14:00 GMT before increasing the position further in the following hours.  The trade will likely be closed before tomorrow's daily trade summary and we will report back with profit/loss status at this point.  The only other signals that have been validated today happened outside of normal trading hours.  All other signals have thus far not been validated by our AI advisor.</p>

			<h4>September 18th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have yet been taken by the fund.  Trading opened formally at 14:00 GMT.  Since this time no validated signals that we would safely enter have been detected by our system.  Over the weekend a number of long positions appeared on most currency pairs.  At this time the majority of them have not reached a close point which means that these are waiting for a short position to come in or another valid long that would suggest another significant rise.  The only signal to be validated so far today was a short on XRP.  The specific type of signal is one that we rarely enter a trade on and normally use to exit a trade.  Due to these facts no trades have been taken since trading commenced.</p>
			<p>We are aware that everybody is keen for us to make our first trades, but please bear in mind that although we have now started to trade we do not enter a trade without a very high degree of certainty.  As we've not had this today no trades have been entered.</p>
