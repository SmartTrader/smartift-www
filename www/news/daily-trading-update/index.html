			<h4>November 17th 09:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>The BTC position has been closed for $10,060.95 profit at a price of $7,868.24 (with 2.524 BTC having already been sold at lower prices).  This was closed after BTC reached a new level of VSR and valid weakness signal was encountered.</p>
			<p>A very small ($1.60 profit) test trade that had been omitted from the trade spreadsheet was also added.</p>
			<p>The total Forex trade profit, after fees, for the month stands at $1,437.</p>

			<h4>November 16th 05:41 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  There are a couple of trades on CFD off the daily chart that I will report when closed.</p>
			<p>We spent much of today going over some major updates to our Smart VSA platforms.  These should help us capture more moves in all markets and especially crypto.  There is some work to do still and I hope to get it up and running in the next few days.  I'll provide more details in the coming days on these developments.</p>
			<p>The BTC position is still open.  No additions were made to the position and none was closed.</p>

			<h4>November 15th 04:23 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  A total of $230.00 profit was made on CFD trades this includes the trade overnight mentioned in the update yesterday.  As I mentioned in the room earlier today, the profit is on a trade size in most cases roughly one tenth of normal.  There were no daily Forex trades so I started working out smaller/faster trades on shorter timeframes and used smaller trades sizes accordingly.  The BTC position is still active and while we missed a signal over night to add on we have not yet gotten a short signal to exit. We will update on this and any other positions as needed.</p>

			<h4>November 14th 04:58 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  We did some small testing on CFD positions in Forex intraday as no daily signals for the charts we look at occured.  Each trade was profitable but in terms of actual dollars traded and profited it wasn't very much as we were testing.  We have some trades open with profit targets that should hit overnight.  They will be reported tomorrow.  The BTC position is still open and I expect we may hold it a little while longer.  We are going to trade within the position a bit starting tomorrow if we have trade signals worth executing.  Today saw mostly some more shifting around with nothing safe in terms of opening positions for the fund.</p>

			<h4>November 12th 11:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have been closed since Friday and a <a href="/news/bch-btc-trading-update/index.html">separate statement has been issued</a> on the BCH/BTC volatility.</p>

			<h4>November 10th 05:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed today.  CFD Forex trades had only one trade which was closed for a profit at the start of the trading day for $1075.00.</p>
			<p>Signals we trade were fairly nonexistent on everything or were invalidated by our advisory systems throughout most of the day.  It is likely do to the news yesterday as things fall back into line in terms of "normal" trading such as it is.</p>
			<p>In regards to CFD movement and Forex,  Forex too had no valid trades today.  As mentioned in the channel earlier today  we are going to start developing and testing some techniques to try and capture more of the moves on days when volume activity doesn't offer much in terms of clear direction intra day but longer term moves are anticipated.  As always this will be discussed when finalized with SIFT holders.</p>

			<h4>November 9th 09:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Yesterday ETHUSD and XRPUSD trades were closed out for profits of 5.14% and 5.61% respectively.  The Segwit2x announcement and impact on the market caused us to assess our current Bitcoin stratergy and we <a href="https://smartift.com/news/btc-fork-cancellation-trading-update/">released a detailed statement</a> on this issue.  Forex trading saw several small lots traded for an additional $222 increasing monthly forex profits to $1,032.</p>

			<h4>November 8th 2017 04:31 GMT</h4>
			<p>We closed a long position today on LTC for 7.53%  It was a small position on an exchange account from USDT Movement and DCA on valid system signals.</p>
			<p>We had a long CFD Forex that was closed.  Profit for CFD account is +911.00.  There are some other trades open currently and made some more movement in regards to positioning for the upcoming BTC fork.</p>

			<h4>November 7th 2017 03:57 GMT</h4>
			<p>No exchange trades were closed yesterday.  There were a number of moves on the trading front both towards the upcoming fork accumulation as well as Forex and CFD trading. These will be reported after clarification with the team.</p>

			<h4>November 4th 2017 06:40 GMT</h4>

			<h4>October 24th 2017 08:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Two trades were closed this morning.  Both positions were longs opened yesterday.  An ETH long closed for 6.46% profit whilst the LTC long closed for 6.42% profit.  The total profit for these trades was $1,369.  Had we been trading with full fund value and maintained this percentage, the combined profit would have been approximately $33,000.  The trading value was limited yesterday as it was the first set of live trades using a change to our algorithms that we have been testing offline for the past two weeks.  We limited the maximum trading fund value to approximately $50,000 yesterday.  Today we will double that to $100,000.  Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">our trading spreadsheet</a> for more details.</p>

			<h4>October 21st 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 20th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>A 20 Bitcoin buy order was closed yesterday realising a profit of $1,531.  The trade was for $111,640 and returned a 1.37% profit.  We exited as planned near the peak of yesterday's market but current liquidity issues, even with a slow-close over 30 minutes, took the price at close down to an average of $5,674.28.  A full analysis of this trade was provided in the <a href="https://t.me/smartift">Telegram room</a>.  Had we traded the full $515,715 allocated to Bitcoin and been able to exit at the market price this trade would have seen a $10,000 profit.  The on-going liquidity issues and solutions to them have been discussed in Telegram today and will be included in the end-of-month report due shortly. Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">the trade spreadsheet</a> for more details.</p>

			<h4>October 19th 2017 10:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 18th 2017 10:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 17th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 14th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.  The only trades yesterday were invalidated by climax bars and weekend trading conditions.  The fund is fully in USD before the weekend.</p>

			<h4>October 13th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>We have closed out three long positions in DASH, ETH and LTC for a combined profit of $9,014.13.  These trades only used a combined exposure of $138,710.  Had the maximum amounts been traded for these pairs and the exit prices remained the same the profit would have been $46,842.  Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">the trade spreadsheet</a> for a full summary of these trades.  No other positions are currently open.</p>

			<h4>October 12th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.  There are a number of trades currently open and these will be reported on when they are closed.</p>

			<h4>October 11th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 10th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>We executed a trade using company funds to purchase ETH on October 2nd.  This was to move a balance between exchanges.  Because this was not originally for investment purposes it was not reported at the time.  However, the movement ended up generating a profit of $5,947.85 and we have attributed that profit to the fund.</p>

			<p>The chat channel mentioned yesterday that we were in a short position.  The market direction quickly reversed and we attempted to close the trade.  Due to problems with an exchange under DDoS at the time we wanted to close the trade it meant that the trade turned into a loss.  We monitored the trade and gradually closed it out over the intervening hours.  Due to exchange issues with this trade we are absorbing the loss from this trade out of our own profits.  We have also implemented an algorithm change to prevent these trades being flagged in the future and will discuss this in full detail in the first monthly summary.</p>

			<h4>October 7th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were opened on Friday after climax bars came in on all markets.</p>

			<h4>October 6th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We have closed out both long positions we had open on BTC and ETH as these stalled slightly below their target prices but climax bars suggested upcoming instability in prices.  These closed out for 1.59% and 2.15% profit respectively and can be found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">our trade spreadsheet</a>.  No additional trades have been opened.</p>

			<h4>October 5th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The two trades that were opened on October 4th remain open.  Since the trades have opened there has only been minor movement and neither profit nor loss targets for either of these trades has been hit.  The trades will remain open until an appropriate target is hit.</p>

			<h4>October 4th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We are currently in two trades for an exposure of $120,000.  These two trades have not yet closed.  Once they have closed they will be added to the trade spreadsheet.</p>

			<h4>October 3rd 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Today started with many climax bars on all charts.  These signals indicate unpredictable volatility and are often news related.  We do not trade for a number of hours after these bars as part of our risk mitigation strategy for the fund.  No trades were made today as a consequence.</p>

			<h4>September 29th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered no trades today and is ready to begin full levels of trading starting Monday 2nd October.  A full trading update will be given at the end of the day (GMT) on Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 28th 2017 21:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The ETH short-sell that was opened yesterday was closed for 1.33% profit after it met the target price.  No further trades have been taken today.  Signals were detected but outside of trading hours.   As reported previously we are actively looking at changing our trading hours after the market changes post-China.</p>
			<p>The LTCUSD close reported yesterday was detailed as a 2.2% profit based on its opening cost.  The overall profit for this trade should be considered 1.5% as additional LTC were purchased as part of dollar-value-averaging.  Not all of these ETH were held at the same time but this better represents the actual profit-versus-expenditure on the transactions.</p>		  
			<p>We now have the daily trading spreadsheet online which will detail all trades we take.  This will be updated every day with trades once they are closed.  You can access this spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">here</a>.

			<h4>September 27th 2017 23:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD reached its target of $55 and has been closed.  The trade made a profit of 2.2% based on its opening cost of $37,897 and a profit of $818.14.  A new trade has just been entered to short-sell 100 ETH.  Full trading with larger volumes will commence from Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 26th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open but with a much smaller holding.  We are down to 150LTC held from a peak of 1000LTC.  The trade is overall up just over 1% and the remaining LTC will be sold if there is any indication of a breach of lower support levels or if it reaches the trade target of $55.  The market has remained flat with the only valid signals today being near other signals that suggested market indecision or panic moves that we ignore for risk mitigation.</p>
			<p>The following was posted to Telegram by James earlier today: "As you know I ran into some issues trying to exit ltc last week.  It was a bit daunting as it was a pretty small trade and should have been able to exit without an issue.  Many of the systems we worked out for live trading such as spreading out to multiple exchanges are not live until the first so I have no worries in that regard.  I just wanted to let you know why the lack of trades.  Official start is 1st.    Systems are all working and we had some nice valid entries on btc and eth this morning (weakness).  As we are still working out some details I am waiting on taking any trades even if small.  If you have any questions let me know here."</p>

			<h4>September 25th 2017 22:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open and has now returned the fund to profit beyond its original opening levels.  A number of LTC have been slowly sold off today.  The trade is currently at a 1% profit.  There are current signals that suggest this trade may be closed out shortly.  No new trades have been entered today.</p>

			<h4>September 24th 2017 18:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>With the state of the markets over the last week we made a decision to keep the LTC trade open over the weekend to ensure it was not cashed out at a significant loss.  The trade remains open.  The total loss is $3,489.83 at current prices with 850 LTC held.  These have been dollar-value-avereaged to reduce loss with a slow reduction in holding.  A validated strength signal appeared on LTC over the weekend.  Despite SR levels indicating more sideways market movement this was a factor in not closing out the trade early and continuing to monitor it.</p>

			<h4>September 21st 2017 22:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have spent the most of the last 24 hours trending sideways resulting in no opportunities for Smart to enter the market.  This has also resulted in the Litecoin trade opened earlier in the week still being held.  The downward movements in the market today were detected by Smart but the AI advisor warned against entering the trades.  A number of long signals were indicated this evening but these too were warned against by our AI advisor.  As such no new trades have been opened today.</p>

			<h4>September 20th 2017 21:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have remained fairly flat since yesterday.  We have had no additional validated trades and the LTC trade that was opened yesterday remains open and valid.  Currently the trade is at a profit but will remain open until targets are reached.  The nature of the markets over the last 48 hours have limited trading opportunities somewhat.</p>

			<h4>September 19th 2017 20:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered its first trade.  We've taken a long trade on LTC which has still not reached targets for close.  This first trade is only using $37,897 of capital whilst we ramp up trading during this period.  We originally entered the trade at 14:00 GMT before increasing the position further in the following hours.  The trade will likely be closed before tomorrow's daily trade summary and we will report back with profit/loss status at this point.  The only other signals that have been validated today happened outside of normal trading hours.  All other signals have thus far not been validated by our AI advisor.</p>

			<h4>September 18th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have yet been taken by the fund.  Trading opened formally at 14:00 GMT.  Since this time no validated signals that we would safely enter have been detected by our system.  Over the weekend a number of long positions appeared on most currency pairs.  At this time the majority of them have not reached a close point which means that these are waiting for a short position to come in or another valid long that would suggest another significant rise.  The only signal to be validated so far today was a short on XRP.  The specific type of signal is one that we rarely enter a trade on and normally use to exit a trade.  Due to these facts no trades have been taken since trading commenced.</p>
			<p>We are aware that everybody is keen for us to make our first trades, but please bear in mind that although we have now started to trade we do not enter a trade without a very high degree of certainty.  As we've not had this today no trades have been entered.</p>
