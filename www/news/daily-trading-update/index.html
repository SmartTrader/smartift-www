             <h4>April 7th 4:18 GMT</h4>
            <p>Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $920.00 (after-tax $745.20)</p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h4>April 6th 4:18 GMT</h4>
            <p>A lot of news and a lot of volatility left us with a loss on trading forex overnight of $473.32.  We had a number of winning trades today but a well placed stop loss was hit overnight that saved u s quite a bit of downside. Some longer term trades hit targets and some MHTC trades brought us up a bit but when all was said and done we ended the day with a net loss.  Plus side is automation should be starting up and working out some automation for multiple time frames and charts for Forex as well so we can maximize opportunities through out the day and night</p>
            
            
            <h4>April 5th 4:06 GMT</h4>
            <p>A bit of a wonky day today as we had a bit of personal emergency here.  Forex trades were closed for a profit of $240.00 (after-tax profit of $194.4) MHTC trades and a lot of mixed signals.  Some trades are open overnight and I will report on those when closed in tomorrows report</p>

            <h4>March 30th 4:07 GMT</h4>
            <p>MHTC Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $480.50 (After-tax profit of $389.20)..  Work on automation continues.  Hopefully we'll be ready to start this weekend. Ramping up sizing on Forex but a lack of proper signals due to external news/concerns leaves little opportunity in my time zone.  Forex could benefit from some automation as well and we'll look at that as well.</p> 
            
            
            
            
                        <h4>March 29th 5:56 GMT</h4>
            <p>Small MHTC Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $500.00 (After-tax profit of $405.00)..  The trades were mostly flat for the day and really only started to move a short while ago.  Some gave signs of reversals so rather than risk holding them overnighit I can pick it up again in the morning.</p> 
            
            
            
            <h4>March 28th 4:27 GMT</h4>
            <pNo trades closed today.  It was a fairly odd day of mixed signals so I spent most of the day tightening up the rules for the Automation Systems and watching charts.  The forward testing for automation has been going well and I hope to have it ready by the first and possibly some small runs ahead of that.  Forex continues to be a bit risky in light of the trade issues with the US so it is best to sit on the side lines until things start to return to normalcy volume analysis wise.</p>  
            
            
            <h4>March 27th 5:19 GMT</h4>

<h4>March 24th 5:16 PM GMT</h4>
            <p>Most of today was working towards finalizing automation systems.  Some small trades were opened and closed on Forex for a small profit of $709.90 (After-tax profit of $575.01).</p>   
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
                     <h4>March 23rd 5:20 GMT</h4>
            <p>Most of today was working towards finalizing automation systems.  That said some small trades were opened and closed on Forex for a small profit of $236.78 (After-tax profit of $191.79)
            Another crazy day news wise which kept things a bit too volatile to see through.</p>

            <p>Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $821.98 (After-tax profit of $665.80)
            A bit of a crazy day news wise in Forex as a result a number of positions were closed out pretty quickly and some have some DD currently.  Nothing too worrying and will keep my eye on things a bit overnight.  USD weakness should abate and wind down some of these positions</p>  
            
            
            
            <h4>March 21th 6:05 GMT</h4>
            <p>Very small Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $154.50 (After-tax profit of $125.14)
            Not much happening with USD.  I expected to see some weakness and took some positions using MHTC but mainly we are flat to down on them.  I expect that we will see them closed overnight.  Automation testing is still going very well and we'll discuss starting it out possibly as early as tomorrow (my time).</p>

<p>It was an extremely slow day trade wise.  We only closed one trade as signal reversed and it never hit the target we only booked a very small gain as a result.

<p> Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $1009.85 ($817.97 after-tax)  Didn't quite reach targets on Crypto.  I am starting up work on group trades (baskets) in Forex which, when complete should increase the daily numbers quite a bit as we open many more trades per signal.  I posted a link in the Telegram Channel if anyone is interested in learning more.  As always any questions just submit them in the channel and I'll help as best I can.</p>

            <p>Crypto:</p>

<p> We had a fairly nice move up in most crypto positions and closed some smaller positions to book profits.  These trades are listed below. 
            
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Crypto Trades Closed Today:<br />

BTC: $1086.70 (13.26%)  After-Tax $880.23 (9.47%)<br />
ETH: $481.48 (9.53%) After-Tax $390.00 (7.02%)<br />
LTC: $6734.25 (33.34%)  After-Tax $5,545.74 (20.22%)<br />
DASH: $774.82 (15.42%)  After-Tax $627.61 (10.78%)<br />
XRP: $1744.82 (34.41%)  After-Tax $1413.30 (20.67%)<br />
            </p>

<p>Total Profit Today in Crypto is $10822.07 After-Tax $8765.87</p>

<p>I was a bit wiped out this evening and had some issues with the reporting system as there were multiple trades in LTC and I couldn't see a way to cope with this in the current system without taking a lot more time.  These numbers should be spot on but may be revised upwards or downwards slightly if any issues are found.  I'll ask Guy take a look when he's up which should be soon so keep an eye out for a revised report if needed.</p>

<p>Forex:<br /> 
    I had a bit of a mishap while remoting in using my phone to check positions earlier today.  I inadvertently closed two trades as a result of lag (I assume) using remote desktop.  I wasn't even aware that they had closed until I had gotten back to the office and checked properly. I will disabled one click trading as a precaution when away in the future. Those trades as well as some other trades closed at profit resulted in a net loss of $1654.79 in our forex account.</p>

            <p>As some as you know I have not updated forward facing sheets for trades.  I will update and finalize these over the coming weekend possibly sooner for all crypto trades this month.

			<p>Not much trading wise today due to investor call as well as a family event in the evening.  Some small trades in Forex were closed earlier today for a total profit of $365.41 ($295.98 after tax) and we have some MHTC trades open which I expect to close tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Crypto: I have started some position building at these lower levels in the hopes to bring our average entries down with the expectation that we could see moves upward over the next few days or longer. Weakness was prevalent much of today after some nice moves earlier so not much to report in terms of intraday trades.  I expect Position building will be a beast for us this month if we have some extended moves upward and forex will ramp up too.  </p>
                
                <p>Forex: It has been a slow start this year thus far thanks in part to the rather unpredictable nature of our leader in the US. There are a lot of issues with confidence and currency/market traders and I think that's why it's taking longer to get solid signals.  The same thing happened last year but it was  on track nearly from the start of January.  The quick hits intraday will help and I will continue to do those</p>
            
            
              <h4>February 7th 4:18 GMT</h4>
            
            <p>While we continue to have dollar confidence issues in the US as well as crypto weakness to contend with, I was able to trade quick moves within the moves.  I am likely going to ramp these types of trades up on days where markets are contending with external news as they have been for some time now.  I can explain more in channel if anyone is interested.  Totals for all closed trades are below with detailed positions in crypto listed below that</p>

			<p>Forex trades were closed today for a profit of $3,139.00 bringing the monthly profit to date to $41,460.63.  It's taken a little while to get some signals after the winter slow down but we are seeing more activity now.  Profits were booked and some continuation signals were taken. In Crypto... Light position building was done earlier today at very near what was the bottom of the fairly significant move down.  Position building entails more risk than our normal trading because we hold positions longer and are subject to volatility risks.  Given the large moves down I decided we could start to take some positions.  I may close these out sooner as part of our general trades as some (XRP) are up roughly 40-50% already.  Please note:  Position trades tend to be smaller as we build.  As a result closing them out earlier will result in less profit in terms of actual dollars.  I don't like to discuss open positions because everyone has an opinion but as always I am open to questions and comments.  Have a good day</p>

			<h4>November 16th 05:41 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  There are a couple of trades on CFD off the daily chart that I will report when closed.</p>
			<p>We spent much of today going over some major updates to our Smart VSA platforms.  These should help us capture more moves in all markets and especially crypto.  There is some work to do still and I hope to get it up and running in the next few days.  I'll provide more details in the coming days on these developments.</p>
			<p>The BTC position is still open.  No additions were made to the position and none was closed.</p>

			<h4>November 15th 04:23 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  A total of $230.00 profit was made on CFD trades this includes the trade overnight mentioned in the update yesterday.  As I mentioned in the room earlier today, the profit is on a trade size in most cases roughly one tenth of normal.  There were no daily Forex trades so I started working out smaller/faster trades on shorter timeframes and used smaller trades sizes accordingly.  The BTC position is still active and while we missed a signal over night to add on we have not yet gotten a short signal to exit. We will update on this and any other positions as needed.</p>

			<h4>November 14th 04:58 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades closed today.  We did some small testing on CFD positions in Forex intraday as no daily signals for the charts we look at occured.  Each trade was profitable but in terms of actual dollars traded and profited it wasn't very much as we were testing.  We have some trades open with profit targets that should hit overnight.  They will be reported tomorrow.  The BTC position is still open and I expect we may hold it a little while longer.  We are going to trade within the position a bit starting tomorrow if we have trade signals worth executing.  Today saw mostly some more shifting around with nothing safe in terms of opening positions for the fund.</p>

			<h4>November 12th 11:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have been closed since Friday and a <a href="/news/bch-btc-trading-update/index.html">separate statement has been issued</a> on the BCH/BTC volatility.</p>

			<h4>November 10th 05:15 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed today.  CFD Forex trades had only one trade which was closed for a profit at the start of the trading day for $1075.00.</p>
			<p>Signals we trade were fairly nonexistent on everything or were invalidated by our advisory systems throughout most of the day.  It is likely do to the news yesterday as things fall back into line in terms of "normal" trading such as it is.</p>
			<p>In regards to CFD movement and Forex,  Forex too had no valid trades today.  As mentioned in the channel earlier today  we are going to start developing and testing some techniques to try and capture more of the moves on days when volume activity doesn't offer much in terms of clear direction intra day but longer term moves are anticipated.  As always this will be discussed when finalized with SIFT holders.</p>

			<h4>November 9th 09:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Yesterday ETHUSD and XRPUSD trades were closed out for profits of 5.14% and 5.61% respectively.  The Segwit2x announcement and impact on the market caused us to assess our current Bitcoin stratergy and we <a href="https://smartift.com/news/btc-fork-cancellation-trading-update/">released a detailed statement</a> on this issue.  Forex trading saw several small lots traded for an additional $222 increasing monthly forex profits to $1,032.</p>

			<p>Two trades were closed this morning.  Both positions were longs opened yesterday.  An ETH long closed for 6.46% profit whilst the LTC long closed for 6.42% profit.  The total profit for these trades was $1,369.  Had we been trading with full fund value and maintained this percentage, the combined profit would have been approximately $33,000.  The trading value was limited yesterday as it was the first set of live trades using a change to our algorithms that we have been testing offline for the past two weeks.  We limited the maximum trading fund value to approximately $50,000 yesterday.  Today we will double that to $100,000.

			<h4>October 20th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>A 20 Bitcoin buy order was closed yesterday realising a profit of $1,531.  The trade was for $111,640 and returned a 1.37% profit.  We exited as planned near the peak of yesterday's market but current liquidity issues, even with a slow-close over 30 minutes, took the price at close down to an average of $5,674.28.  A full analysis of this trade was provided in the <a href="https://t.me/smartift">Telegram room</a>.  Had we traded the full $515,715 allocated to Bitcoin and been able to exit at the market price this trade would have seen a $10,000 profit.  The on-going liquidity issues and solutions to them have been discussed in Telegram today and will be included in the end-of-month report due shortly.

			<p>We have closed out three long positions in DASH, ETH and LTC for a combined profit of $9,014.13.  These trades only used a combined exposure of $138,710.  Had the maximum amounts been traded for these pairs and the exit prices remained the same the profit would have been $46,842.  Please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">the trade spreadsheet</a> for a full summary of these trades.  No other positions are currently open.</p>

			<h4>October 12th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.  There are a number of trades currently open and these will be reported on when they are closed.</p>

			<h4>October 11th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were closed yesterday.</p>

			<h4>October 10th 2017 09:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>We executed a trade using company funds to purchase ETH on October 2nd.  This was to move a balance between exchanges.  Because this was not originally for investment purposes it was not reported at the time.  However, the movement ended up generating a profit of $5,947.85 and we have attributed that profit to the fund.</p>

			<p>The chat channel mentioned yesterday that we were in a short position.  The market direction quickly reversed and we attempted to close the trade.  Due to problems with an exchange under DDoS at the time we wanted to close the trade it meant that the trade turned into a loss.  We monitored the trade and gradually closed it out over the intervening hours.  Due to exchange issues with this trade we are absorbing the loss from this trade out of our own profits.  We have also implemented an algorithm change to prevent these trades being flagged in the future and will discuss this in full detail in the first monthly summary.</p>

			<h4>October 7th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades were opened on Friday after climax bars came in on all markets.</p>

			<h4>October 6th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We have closed out both long positions we had open on BTC and ETH as these stalled slightly below their target prices but climax bars suggested upcoming instability in prices.  These closed out for 1.59% and 2.15% profit respectively and can be found on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">our trade spreadsheet</a>.  No additional trades have been opened.</p>

			<h4>October 5th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The two trades that were opened on October 4th remain open.  Since the trades have opened there has only been minor movement and neither profit nor loss targets for either of these trades has been hit.  The trades will remain open until an appropriate target is hit.</p>

			<h4>October 4th 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>We are currently in two trades for an exposure of $120,000.  These two trades have not yet closed.  Once they have closed they will be added to the trade spreadsheet.</p>

			<h4>October 3rd 2017 10:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>Today started with many climax bars on all charts.  These signals indicate unpredictable volatility and are often news related.  We do not trade for a number of hours after these bars as part of our risk mitigation strategy for the fund.  No trades were made today as a consequence.</p>

			<h4>September 29th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered no trades today and is ready to begin full levels of trading starting Monday 2nd October.  A full trading update will be given at the end of the day (GMT) on Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 28th 2017 21:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The ETH short-sell that was opened yesterday was closed for 1.33% profit after it met the target price.  No further trades have been taken today.  Signals were detected but outside of trading hours.   As reported previously we are actively looking at changing our trading hours after the market changes post-China.</p>
			<p>The LTCUSD close reported yesterday was detailed as a 2.2% profit based on its opening cost.  The overall profit for this trade should be considered 1.5% as additional LTC were purchased as part of dollar-value-averaging.  Not all of these ETH were held at the same time but this better represents the actual profit-versus-expenditure on the transactions.</p>		  
			<p>We now have the daily trading spreadsheet online which will detail all trades we take.  This will be updated every day with trades once they are closed.  You can access this spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i7rC9Gd-bgK6NdlSz_5jSQ7j-EpWTKfLRDKqNJQ1AMY">here</a>.

			<h4>September 27th 2017 23:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD reached its target of $55 and has been closed.  The trade made a profit of 2.2% based on its opening cost of $37,897 and a profit of $818.14.  A new trade has just been entered to short-sell 100 ETH.  Full trading with larger volumes will commence from Monday 2nd October.</p>

			<h4>September 26th 2017 09:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open but with a much smaller holding.  We are down to 150LTC held from a peak of 1000LTC.  The trade is overall up just over 1% and the remaining LTC will be sold if there is any indication of a breach of lower support levels or if it reaches the trade target of $55.  The market has remained flat with the only valid signals today being near other signals that suggested market indecision or panic moves that we ignore for risk mitigation.</p>
			<p>The following was posted to Telegram by James earlier today: "As you know I ran into some issues trying to exit ltc last week.  It was a bit daunting as it was a pretty small trade and should have been able to exit without an issue.  Many of the systems we worked out for live trading such as spreading out to multiple exchanges are not live until the first so I have no worries in that regard.  I just wanted to let you know why the lack of trades.  Official start is 1st.    Systems are all working and we had some nice valid entries on btc and eth this morning (weakness).  As we are still working out some details I am waiting on taking any trades even if small.  If you have any questions let me know here."</p>

			<h4>September 25th 2017 22:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The LTCUSD trade remains open and has now returned the fund to profit beyond its original opening levels.  A number of LTC have been slowly sold off today.  The trade is currently at a 1% profit.  There are current signals that suggest this trade may be closed out shortly.  No new trades have been entered today.</p>

			<h4>September 24th 2017 18:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>With the state of the markets over the last week we made a decision to keep the LTC trade open over the weekend to ensure it was not cashed out at a significant loss.  The trade remains open.  The total loss is $3,489.83 at current prices with 850 LTC held.  These have been dollar-value-avereaged to reduce loss with a slow reduction in holding.  A validated strength signal appeared on LTC over the weekend.  Despite SR levels indicating more sideways market movement this was a factor in not closing out the trade early and continuing to monitor it.</p>

			<h4>September 21st 2017 22:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have spent the most of the last 24 hours trending sideways resulting in no opportunities for Smart to enter the market.  This has also resulted in the Litecoin trade opened earlier in the week still being held.  The downward movements in the market today were detected by Smart but the AI advisor warned against entering the trades.  A number of long signals were indicated this evening but these too were warned against by our AI advisor.  As such no new trades have been opened today.</p>

			<h4>September 20th 2017 21:45 GMT</h4>
			<p>The markets have remained fairly flat since yesterday.  We have had no additional validated trades and the LTC trade that was opened yesterday remains open and valid.  Currently the trade is at a profit but will remain open until targets are reached.  The nature of the markets over the last 48 hours have limited trading opportunities somewhat.</p>

			<h4>September 19th 2017 20:30 GMT</h4>
			<p>The fund has entered its first trade.  We've taken a long trade on LTC which has still not reached targets for close.  This first trade is only using $37,897 of capital whilst we ramp up trading during this period.  We originally entered the trade at 14:00 GMT before increasing the position further in the following hours.  The trade will likely be closed before tomorrow's daily trade summary and we will report back with profit/loss status at this point.  The only other signals that have been validated today happened outside of normal trading hours.  All other signals have thus far not been validated by our AI advisor.</p>

			<h4>September 18th 2017 21:00 GMT</h4>
			<p>No trades have yet been taken by the fund.  Trading opened formally at 14:00 GMT.  Since this time no validated signals that we would safely enter have been detected by our system.  Over the weekend a number of long positions appeared on most currency pairs.  At this time the majority of them have not reached a close point which means that these are waiting for a short position to come in or another valid long that would suggest another significant rise.  The only signal to be validated so far today was a short on XRP.  The specific type of signal is one that we rarely enter a trade on and normally use to exit a trade.  Due to these facts no trades have been taken since trading commenced.</p>
			<p>We are aware that everybody is keen for us to make our first trades, but please bear in mind that although we have now started to trade we do not enter a trade without a very high degree of certainty.  As we've not had this today no trades have been entered.</p>
